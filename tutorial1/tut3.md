# Distributed Ledger
A distributed ledger is a database that is shared and synchronized across multiple computers. This means that there is no single central authority that controls the ledger. Instead, each computer in the network has a copy of the ledger, and all changes to the ledger must be agreed upon by all of the computers in the network.
