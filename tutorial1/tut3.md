# Distributed Ledger
A distributed ledger is a database that is shared and synchronized across multiple computers. This means that there is no single central authority that controls the ledger. Instead, each computer in the network has a copy of the ledger, and all changes to the ledger must be agreed upon by all of the computers in the network.

A distributed ledger is like a digital version of this notebook. It is a shared database that everyone in the network has access to. When someone adds a new transaction to the distributed ledger, it is verified by all of the computers in the network and then added to the shared database. This way, everyone can see all of the transactions and no one can tamper with the data without everyone else's knowledge.
