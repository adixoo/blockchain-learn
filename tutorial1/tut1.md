# Blockchain Intro
Blockchain, in simple terms, is a digital ledger or a chain of blocks that records transactions in a secure and transparent way. Imagine it as a shared digital notebook that multiple people can access and update, but once something is written down, it can't be easily erased or changed.

## Blockchain Working (story)
Imagine a group of friends who are keeping track of their money together. They write down all of their transactions in a notebook, and everyone in the group has a copy of the notebook. This way, everyone can see all of the transactions and no one can cheat by changing the notebook without everyone else's knowledge.

A blockchain is like a digital version of this notebook. It's a shared ledger that everyone in the network has access to. When someone adds a new transaction to the blockchain, it is verified by all of the computers in the network and then added to the shared ledger. This way, everyone can see all of the transactions and no one can tamper with the data without everyone else's knowledge.

**Question**: How can we design blockchain systems that protect user privacy while still maintaining the transparency and security that blockchain technology is known for?
