# Decentralization

Decentralization is the process of distributing power and control from a central authority to many smaller, decentralized ones.

## Decentralization (analogy to explain)
Imagine a school where all of the decisions are made by the principal. This is a centralized system. The principal has all of the power and control.

Now imagine a school where the decisions are made by a committee of teachers, students, and parents. This is a decentralized system. The power and control is distributed among many different people.
